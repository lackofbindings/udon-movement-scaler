# Movement Scaler 
by lackofbindings

A simple script that scales the player's movement speed based on the height of their avatar.

## Installation

To install just drag the prefab anywhere into your scene. 

If a window pops up asking you about Text Mesh Pro just click the first button and let it do it.
If you don't want the debug display it is safe to remove it or set it to EditorOnly.

If you want to toggle it in-game it is safe to use any script/animation to toggle the enabled state on the root game object.

⚠️ Does not work in Client Sim, may throw errors. (tested in ClientSim v1.2.6)
